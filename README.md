# Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project implements a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for analyzing, predicting, and visualizing heart disease risks using the UCI Heart Disease Dataset. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, feature selection, dimensionality reduction (PCA), supervised and unsupervised learning, hyperparameter tuning, model export, and a Streamlit UI for user interaction.

## Project Overview
The goal is to build a machine learning model to predict heart disease based on health data, with a focus on:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Applying PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- Feature selection using statistical and ML-based methods.
- Training supervised models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM).
- Applying unsupervised learning (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering).
- Optimizing models with hyperparameter tuning.
- Deploying a Streamlit UI for real-time predictions and visualizations.

## Features
- Predict heart disease risk based on user-input health data.
- Visualize trends using histograms and correlation heatmaps.
- Export logged data for further analysis.
- Deployable via Ngrok for public access.
